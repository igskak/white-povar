## Upcoming Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** - Add required environment variables to repository settings
2. **Test Workflow Deployment** - Trigger manual deployment to verify setup  
3. **Monitor Build Status** - Ensure all workflows pass successfully

### Production Readiness
- Replace backend `SECRET_KEY` placeholder for production
- Confirm Supabase RLS policies are applied in production
- Validate all CI/CD secrets for `--dart-define` values during builds

## Known Issues

### Current Status
- **All major build failures resolved** ✅
- **Workflow files created and documented** ✅
- **Manual setup required**: GitHub Secrets need to be configured by user

### Setup Requirements
- **Firebase deployment token** needs to be generated and added to secrets
- **Render deployment hook** must be configured from service dashboard
- **Environment variables** should be validated before first production deployment
