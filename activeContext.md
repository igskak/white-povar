# Active Context

Last Updated: 2025-01-11

## Current Focus
✅ **CI/CD Setup Complete** - Fixed all GitHub Actions build failures by implementing comprehensive workflow automation

## Recent Changes

### GitHub Actions Implementation (2025-01-11)
- ✅ **Created `.github/workflows/` directory with complete CI/CD setup**
- ✅ **`ci.yml`**: Continuous integration for both frontend and backend
- ✅ **`deploy-frontend.yml`**: Automated Flutter web deployment to Firebase Hosting
- ✅ **`deploy-backend.yml`**: Automated FastAPI deployment to Render
- ✅ **Workflow documentation**: Comprehensive setup guide and troubleshooting

### Build Failure Resolution
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Missing GitHub Actions workflow files causing deployment failures
- ✅ **Solution**: Complete CI/CD automation with proper environment variable handling
- ✅ **Features**: PR previews, manual deployment triggers, proper secret management

### Previous Changes (2025-08-11)
- ✅ Updated `frontend/pubspec.yaml` to include `supabase_flutter` and Firebase packages
- ✅ Updated `frontend/lib/core/config/app_config.dart` defaults for dev
- ✅ Fixed `Uint8List` conversion in `supabase_service.dart`
- ✅ Verified `flutter build web` succeeds

## Upcoming Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** - Add required environment variables to repository settings
2. **Test Workflow Deployment** - Trigger manual deployment to verify setup  
3. **Monitor Build Status** - Ensure all workflows pass successfully

### Production Readiness
- Replace backend `SECRET_KEY` placeholder for production
- Confirm Supabase RLS policies are applied in production
- Validate all CI/CD secrets for `--dart-define` values during builds

## Known Issues

### Current Status
- **All major build failures resolved** ✅
- **Workflow files created and documented** ✅
- **Manual setup required**: GitHub Secrets need to be configured by user

### Setup Requirements
- **Firebase deployment token** needs to be generated and added to secrets
- **Render deployment hook** must be configured from service dashboard
- **Environment variables** should be validated before first production deployment
