# Progress

## Recently Completed (2025-08-24)
- ✅ **Database Schema Normalized**: Comprehensive normalized schema with proper relationships
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Removed 23 temporary files and build artifacts
- ✅ **Ingredient System**: Units, categories, and base ingredients properly structured
- ✅ **Recipe System**: Normalized recipe ingredients with nutrition tracking
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Added indexes for search and query performance

## Previously Completed
- ✅ Frontend connected to Supabase with real credentials
- ✅ Firebase packages enabled; project builds for web
- ✅ Fixed storage upload type (`Uint8List`)
- ✅ Updated documentation and project intelligence
- ✅ CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions

## Next Steps
- Update backend code to work with new normalized schema
- Implement recipe data import/migration tools for new schema
- Update frontend to use new API endpoints
- Test the complete flow with new database structure

## Remaining (Production)
- Rotate and set strong `SECRET_KEY` in backend for production
- Audit and enforce Supabase RLS policies
- Configure CI/CD to inject dart-defines securely

## Known Issues
- Backend needs updates to work with new schema
- Style lints in some frontend files (non-blocking)
